Description: Provides a suite of functions to support the cleaning, validation, 
    harmonization, and formatting of rabies laboratory data prior to uploading 
    to REDCap. The package standardizes common data processing steps including 
    recoding based on dictionary mappings, handling duplicates, generating REDCap-compatible 
    diagnostic and sequencing forms, and classifying diagnostic results from multiple test inputs. 
    These tools are designed to minimize manual effort and interpersonal variability 
    in multi-country genomic surveillance workflows.
